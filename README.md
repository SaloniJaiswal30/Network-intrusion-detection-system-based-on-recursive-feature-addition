# Network-intrusion-detection-system-based-on-recursive-feature-addition
Itâ€™s a project in which unknown attack is detected. Detection using machine learning techniques are time consuming therefore efficient feature selection algorithm is used to make the classification process fast.
### Technology Used
Python
### Description
- Dataset Used: 100 malicious files has been used as dataset. Features has been extracted out of it and used as an dataset using feature_extraction.py
- Rankinh the datset features using CFS(Correlation feature selection)
- Selected beat subset using Recursive feature elimination
- classification using SVM
